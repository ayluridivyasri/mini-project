# Introduction
# Calculating the Parameters of Dc motor
It is a program written in order to calculate the required parameters of the motor. User has to give the inputs of the motor like voltage,current,speed etc.By using these parameter, the required parameter be calculated.

The Outputs of this program are
1. Efficiency
2. Voltage Regulation
3. Torque
