# Requirements
## Introduction
. Dc motors are used to convert electrical energy to mechanical energy.

. Applications of Dc motor includes conveyors,blowers, fans, machine tools, pumps, turbines, power tools, alternators, compressors, rolling mills, ships, movers, paper mills.

.The main objective of this program is to tell the customers whether the choosen Dc motor is efficient or not.

# Research
## History
. In 1834, Russian engineer Moritz von Jacobi went on to invent the very first rotating DC motor.

. His invention became famous for being incredibly powerful, which later set a world record. Incredibly, he broke his own world record in 1838 with a new and improved version of his DC motor invention.

. This motor motivated others to produce DC motors of the same powerful standard, with the ability to drive a boat with a capacity of 14 people across a river.

## Types of Dc motors

There are mainly 4 types of Dc motors namely:

1.Separately excited d.c. machine

2.Shunt wound or shunt machine.

3.Series wound or series machine.

4.Compound wound or compound machine.
# Swot Analysis
## Strengths
i. Easy to use and Implement.

ii. Helps the customer for choosing better machine.

iii. Dc motors are mostly used in Industrial applications.

iv. Dc motors have adjustable spped.

## Weakness

i. Inputs are given manually.

ii. Increases manual work for giving inputs.

iii. Customer should have minimum knownledge about Dc motor.

## Opportunities
i. The program can be further developed based on the required parameter needed by the customers.

## Threats
i. Due to development of different types of machine, the usage of Dc motors are slightly reduced.
# 4W's and 1H
